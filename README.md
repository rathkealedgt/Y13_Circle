# Y13_Circle
Introduction to creating classes using VB .NET

Clone this repository and open it in VS. Read the main subroutine and see if you can predict the outcome. Then run the program to see if you were correct. Tinker with the code so that the radius of the circle is printed as well.

Leave the original code in Sub Main as is. Create a new point at (-5, -9). Then create a new circle using that point with a radius of 5. Print out the same information as the original circle. Then push your updated program to GitHub.
